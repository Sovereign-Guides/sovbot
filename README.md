This is the source code for [SovBot#9299](https://discord.com/users/1000927602518798487). It is primarily written by me,
[zay#6353](https://discord.com/users/452793411401940995). I use [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) with JavaScript 
purely because that's just what I know, though I have eventual plans to re-write this in 
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (PRs welcome)!
